It is one thing to automatically detect that a particular word occurs in a text, and to
display some words that appear in the same context. However, we can also determine
the location of a word in the text: how many words from the beginning it appears. This
positional information can be displayed using a dispersion plot. Each stripe represents
an instance of a word, and each row represents the entire text.
